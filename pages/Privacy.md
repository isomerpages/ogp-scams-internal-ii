<h5>ScamShield App:</h5>
<p>The ScamShield App is an application that works actively in the background
to facilitate the detection, reporting and blocking of potential scam calls,
as well as potential scam messages from unknown numbers not in your contact
list.</p>
<p>The application does <strong>not</strong> have access to your contact list
or any private data found therein. Further, ScamShield cannot access the
contents of SMSes already in your inbox prior to installation of ScamShield,
and it cannot access your call log.</p>
<p>We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and we only store the data
necessary for the App to function. Further, we align ourselves with the
strict privacy parameters set by Apple for iOS, and by Google for Android,
and we follow the commercial best practices of data protection and data
governance.</p>
<p>For full transparency, the only data we collect and store from the Apps
include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Contents of messages that are flagged up by the ScamShield App as potential
scam messages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sender ID and/or contact number(s) of the person who sends such potential
scam messages</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not store any other data and there are no identifiers to trace back
to any individual users of the application. For the avoidance of doubt,
only SMSes that the ScamShield application determines to be potential scams
are automatically reported and sent to the Singapore Police Force, and
the ScamShield App does not have the capability to read <strong>any</strong> other
messages on your phone.</p>
<p>ScamShield works hard to ensure that you are protected from scam messages,
however, like all technology, it is not perfect, and some legitimate personal
messages may be wrongly classified as potential scam messages. You need
not worry, we do not take any further action on these messages, but may
use them to train the machine learning algorithm to better recognize which
messages are scam and which messages are not. If you feel that a message
was wrongly classified as scam, you may write in to us at <a href="mailto:scamshield@ncpc.org.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>scamshield@ncpc.org.sg</u></a>.</p>
<p>Upon the conclusion of their review process, the Singapore Police Force
may recommend to blacklist numbers that are involved in scam activities.
The SPF may also work with the Ministry of Communications and Information
(“MCI”) for further investigations, if necessary. All information will
be kept strictly confidential for the purposes of such investigations.</p>
<p>If you feel that your number might have been blocked as a scam number
by ScamShield, you may write in to <a href="mailto:scamshield@ncpc.org.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>scamshield@ncpc.org.sg</u></a>.
This is subject to the conclusion of the review process by the Singapore
Police Force regarding your number.</p>
<h4>Tailoring Your Experience</h4>
<p>Users may, at their full discretion, turn off any or all of the features
of ScamShield on their devices. By going to the device settings, you can
turn off the automatic filtering and reporting of scam messages, the automatic
blocking of calls from scam numbers, and you can even turn off push notifications
on the latest scam typologies. By doing so, you acknowledge that your user
experience will be affected and the application will not function as intended.</p>
